# custom_chatbot_NYP_robotics

The files working are "test_custom_chatbot_1.ipynb" and "test_custom_chatbot_2.ipynb".
"test_custom_chatbot_5.ipynb" is also working but does not have any training, it is a simple chatbot.

The "webscrapping_test3.py" file is used to scrappe data from the NYP website. It creates a json (can create a jsonl file) entitled "test_json.json" (or "test_jsonl.jsonl").

The "nb_token.py" file was create to count the number of token of a file, but it response is different from what "test_custom_chatbot_2.ipynb" says.
