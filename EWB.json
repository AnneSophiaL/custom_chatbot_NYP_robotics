This module provides the foundation for learner to demonstrate understanding of process modelling, analysing and streamlining of business data and processes.\n                                                              This module provides learners the key concepts in supply chain management (SCM). Learners will learn how SCM is enabled through IT, and to be an integral part of strategy and operations management in the logistics, retail, services and manufacturing industries. The focus will be on global supply chain strategies for the integration of supply chain components into a coordinated system to enhance service level and reduce system-wide cost.\nThis module aims to equip learners with the fundamental of product design, covering the design process, product types, product evaluation and the manufacturing methods. Learners will learn the importance of design for environment and sustainability, design for manufacturability, design for assembly and how these concepts can be integrated into the product design. Learners will be able to apply the knowledge learned to design new product using 3D computer-assisted drafting and design system (CADD).\n                                                                                                                                                       This module provides a management approach in managing a product lifecycle and its impact on the product supply chain. This module provides the foundation for learner to demonstrate an understanding of Product Lifecyle Management (PLM) information and digital flow in order to make information-driven decisions at every phase of the product lifecycle.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Final-year students will also have the opportunity to undertake a full-time project and participate in a local or overseas internship programme for one full semester."
